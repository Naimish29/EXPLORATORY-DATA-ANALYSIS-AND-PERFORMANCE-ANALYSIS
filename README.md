EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS-AND-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends, correlations, and performance insights from complex datasets using Python. The goal was to transform raw data into meaningful visual insights to support data-driven decision-making.

->Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

->Key Highlights
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Conducted EDA to identify performance trends, outliers, and correlations across multiple variables.
Created interactive visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight patterns and trends for stakeholders.
Optimized workflows for faster data handling and reporting, improving overall efficiency in analysis pipelines.

->Outcome
Delivered clear, data-backed insights that improved stakeholder understanding of the dataset and informed strategic decisions. This project demonstrates proficiency in data wrangling, visualization, and exploratory analysis using Python.
